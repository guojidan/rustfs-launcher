# Repository Guidelines

Use this guide when contributing to RustFS Launcher; it highlights the project layout, tooling, and expectations.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/`: Leptos client entrypoint (`main.rs`), UI composition (`app.rs`), and contextual styles (`logs.css`).
- `src-tauri/src/`: Tauri backend modules: `commands.rs` for invokable actions, `process.rs` for RustFS binary orchestration, `state.rs` for shared application state, plus error types.
- `src-tauri/binaries/`: Platform-specific RustFS executables fetched by the build scripts; keep this directory untracked in Git.
- `public/`: Static assets bundled by Trunk (`leptos.svg`, `tauri.svg`).
- `Trunk.toml` and `tauri.conf.json`: runtime configuration for the web client and desktop shell.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./build.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `build.bat` (Windows): download the matching RustFS binary into `src-tauri/binaries/`.
- `cargo tauri dev`: launch the desktop shell with hot reload across the Rust backend and Leptos UI.
- `trunk serve --port 1421`: run the Leptos client in a browser-only workflow using the `Trunk.toml` settings.
- `cargo tauri build`: produce distributable desktop bundles.
- `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`: enforce formatting and linting before pushing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use idiomatic Rust formatting (4-space indentation, `snake_case` modules/functions, `PascalCase` types, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constants) and guard changes with `cargo fmt`.
Group Leptos components per route, exposing them via `pub fn component_name() -> impl IntoView`.
Keep CSS in `styles.css` or `src/logs.css`, favoring kebab-case class names and scoped selectors.

## Testing Guidelines
Run `cargo test -p rustfs-launcher` to exercise backend modules; add unit tests adjacent to the code under `#[cfg(test)]`.
For logic that shells out to the RustFS binary, add smoke coverage that injects a stub path (see `src-tauri/src/process.rs`).
Document manual UI checks—launcher start-up, binary download, command invocation—in PR descriptions until automated UI tests exist.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) as seen in history; keep the subject ≤72 characters and scope focused.
Split backend and UI updates when practical to aid review.
PRs should include an intent summary, the commands/tests run (or screenshots for UI tweaks), and links to relevant issues.
Request review before merging and wait for CI; resolve any fmt/clippy/test failures locally first.
